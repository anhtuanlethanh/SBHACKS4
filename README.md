Ever took longer to find that math formula in your messy notebook than actually using it?
The Formula(s) For Success gives you a way to enter your formulas, view them, and use them with as many as three clicks.
You can also save files locally and keep all your entered formulas in a folder, then load them whenever you restart the application.
Thank us later for your physics final ;)
